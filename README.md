## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes 6 years of my personal Apple Music listening history (400K+ records) exported directly from Apple's **Data & Privacy** portal.  
Using **Python, SQL, and Tableau**, I processed, cleaned, and visualized the data to uncover trends in top artists, genres, skip behavior, playlist engagement, and listening patterns over time.

The goal was to create a **full end-to-end data pipeline** â€” from raw export to final interactive dashboards â€” showcasing my skills in:
- Data cleaning & transformation
- SQL querying & KPI calculation
- Data visualization & storytelling
- Dashboard design for analytical insights
